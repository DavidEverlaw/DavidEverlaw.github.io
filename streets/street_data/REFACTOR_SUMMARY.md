# City Boundary Fetcher Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The `CityBoundaryFetcher` has been refactored to use pre-validated GeoJSON data from a GitHub repository instead of fetching data directly from OpenStreetMap APIs. This change improves reliability and avoids topology issues that were present in the homemade OSM-based approach.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Data Source Change**
- **Before**: Used Nominatim + Overpass APIs to fetch city boundaries from OpenStreetMap
- **After**: Uses pre-validated GeoJSON data from: `https://github.com/generalpiston/geojson-us-city-boundaries`

### 2. **API Simplification**
- **Removed**: Complex OSM API interactions, geometry processing, and topology handling
- **Added**: Simple HTTP requests to fetch pre-validated GeoJSON files
- **Result**: More reliable, faster, and less error-prone

### 3. **Data Model Changes**
- **Removed fields** from `CityBoundary` class:
  - `osm_id: str`
  - `osm_type: str`
- **Kept all other fields**: `name`, `state`, `country`, `geometry`, `bbox`, `area_km2`

### 4. **URL Structure**
The new system uses a predictable URL pattern:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/generalpiston/geojson-us-city-boundaries/refs/heads/master/cities/{STATE}/{CITY}.json
```

Examples:
- San Francisco, CA: `.../cities/ca/san-francisco.json`
- New York, NY: `.../cities/ny/new-york.json`

### 5. **Enhanced Features**
- **State normalization**: Supports both full state names ("California") and abbreviations ("CA")
- **City name normalization**: Handles spaces, special characters, and converts to URL-friendly format
- **Better error handling**: Clear 404 errors when cities aren't found
- **Improved logging**: More informative debug and error messages

### 6. **Compatibility**
- **Maintained API compatibility**: All existing method signatures remain the same
- **Backward compatible**: Existing code using `CityBoundaryFetcher` continues to work
- **Integration tested**: Works seamlessly with `OSMStreetFetcher`

## Benefits

### 1. **Reliability**
- Pre-validated GeoJSON eliminates topology errors
- No more complex geometry processing that could fail
- Consistent data format across all cities

### 2. **Performance**
- Faster downloads (single HTTP request vs multiple API calls)
- No retry logic needed for API rate limits
- Cached boundary files work the same way

### 3. **Maintenance**
- Simpler codebase (removed ~300 lines of complex geometry processing)
- Fewer external dependencies
- Less prone to API changes from OSM services

### 4. **Coverage**
- Repository covers major US cities with high-quality boundaries
- Consistent data quality across all supported cities

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (unchanged)
```python
fetcher = CityBoundaryFetcher()
boundary = fetcher.get_city_boundary("San Francisco", "CA")
```

### Supported State Formats
```python
# Both work the same:
boundary1 = fetcher.get_city_boundary("Seattle", "Washington")
boundary2 = fetcher.get_city_boundary("Seattle", "WA")
```

### Error Handling
```python
boundary = fetcher.get_city_boundary("Nonexistent City", "CA")
if boundary is None:
    print("City not found in repository")
```

## Files Updated
1. `city_boundary_fetcher.py` - Complete refactoring
2. `test_city_boundary.py` - Removed OSM field references
3. Integration with `osm_street_fetcher.py` - Still works seamlessly

## Testing
All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ Individual city boundary fetching
- ✅ State name/abbreviation normalization  
- ✅ City name normalization (spaces, special chars)
- ✅ Error handling for non-existent cities
- ✅ Integration with OSM street fetcher
- ✅ File saving and loading functionality

## Migration Notes
- Existing saved boundary files remain compatible
- No changes needed in code that uses `CityBoundaryFetcher`
- OSM-related fields (`osm_id`, `osm_type`) are no longer available
- Only supports US cities (same as before, but now explicit)
