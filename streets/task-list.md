5. [x] Show OpenStreetMap with data from street_data folder
6. [x] Optimize how data is shown on map. Current issues
    - Map shows many feature names and colors; It should only show most basic features (e.g. parks, roads, rivers, water, etc.) and should not have any text
    - User should be able to pan and zoom map
    - Map should not show any information outside the region of interest (can be the same color as water outside the region of interest)
